    <h1>A new drug could stop Alzheimer’s before memory loss begins</h1>
    <p class="paragraf1">Scientists at Northwestern University have identified a hidden, highly toxic protein that appears to trigger Alzheimer’s disease.</p>
    <h2>An experimental drug developed at Northwestern University has demonstrated further promise as an early intervention for Alzheimer's disease.</h2>
    <p class="paragraf2">The experimental drug, a small-molecule compound called NU-9, decreased this toxic amyloid beta oligomersubtype and dramatically reduced the damage it causes in a mouse model of Alzheimer's disease. By addressing these changes at the onset of Alzheimer's disease, the researchers are hopeful NU-9 potentially could prevent, or significantly delay, the cascade of toxic events that ultimately destroy neurons.</p>
    <ol>
        <li class="li1">Alzheimer's disease begins decades before its symptoms appear</li>
        <li class="li2">By the time symptoms emerge, the underlying pathology is already advanced</li>
        <li class="li3">This is likely a major reason many clinical trials have failed.</li>
        <li class="li4">They start far too late. </li>
        <li class="li5">In our study, we administered NU-9 before symptom onset, modeling this early, pre-symptomatic window.</li>
